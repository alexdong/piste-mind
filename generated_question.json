  "question": "You're leading 12-10 with 1:45 remaining in the final period of a DE bout. Your opponent is a tall left-hander who has been successfully using a French grip to make angulated flicks to your wrist and forearm throughout the match. After winning the last three touches with this action, they've gained visible confidence and are advancing more aggressively.\n\nYou've noticed they consistently drop their tip low before initiating these flicks, creating a brief opening. However, your last two attempts to exploit this opening with direct attacks failed when they retreated quickly and hit you with counterattacks to the arm. The referee has been calling these actions consistently in their favor. Your legs are starting to feel heavy from the long day of competition.",
  "options": [
    "Maintain distance with small steps backward, forcing them to overextend on their flick attempts, then counter with a direct thrust to the chest when they recover forward.",
    "Close distance aggressively when you see the tip drop, accepting the risk of their flick to get inside their optimal distance and score with opposition to their high line.",
    "Switch to a defensive strategy focused on drawing their attack, then parry-riposte their predictable low-line preparation with a circular six parry.",
    "Use false attacks with pronounced bell movements to trigger their retreat pattern, then accelerate into a second-intention attack to their exposed target as they attempt their counterattack."
