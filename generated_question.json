  "question": "You're fencing in the round of 32 at a World Cup event. The score is 11-11 with 1:47 remaining in the third period. Your opponent is a tall left-handed French fencer (approximately 6'3\") who uses a pistol grip and has been dominating the middle distance throughout the bout. They've scored 7 of their 11 touches with quick direct attacks to your wrist and forearm when you extend, showing exceptional point control and timing. However, you've noticed that after their last water break at 10-10, they're keeping their arm slightly lower than before and their recovery steps have become noticeably shorter - likely due to fatigue in their rear leg. They've also started leaning forward more during their preparations, compromising their balance. The referee has been very consistent in calling simultaneous actions in favor of whoever initiates first, and the metal piste is slightly slippery from condensation, which has caused both fencers to adjust their footwork. Your opponent just scored the last touch with a beautiful disengage-counterdisengage combination when you tried to take their blade in 6, bringing the score to 11-11.",
  "options": [
    "Immediately switch to a deep, patient game focused on drawing their attack. Maintain distance at the far end of attack range, keeping your point low and to the inside line to protect your forearm. Use small, broken-rhythm retreats to frustrate their preparation and force them to overcommit due to their compromised balance. When they finally attack, execute a counterattack in opposition to their outside high line (their 4), taking advantage of their lowered arm position and forward lean to score while closing out their most comfortable finishing angle.",
    "Shift to an aggressive marching attack strategy, but with second intention. Begin with powerful forward steps to push them back, presenting your arm slightly early to invite their habitual attack to your forearm. As they begin their extension, execute a quick evasive action with a ducking parry 2 while continuing forward, then immediately riposte to their exposed low line. Their fatigue and shortened recovery steps will make it difficult for them to retreat effectively, and their forward lean will bring them into your riposte.",
    "Adopt a false attack approach targeting their preparation. Make convincing false attacks with half-advances, deliberately stopping just short of their reaction distance. Watch for the moment they lean forward to prepare their counterattack - their fatigue is making this tell more obvious. On the third or fourth repetition, convert your false attack into a real one with a ballestra-lunge combination, using a low line flick to their thigh or a bind from 6 to 8 to avoid their superior point control in the high lines. The slippery piste will make their forward-leaning recovery even more unstable.",
    "Implement a close-quarters infighting strategy to neutralize their reach advantage and exploit their leg fatigue. Use a series of quick advances with opposition in 6 to safely close distance, accepting that they might attempt to hit your forearm but maintaining strong opposition to make it difficult. Once inside their optimal distance, initiate corps-\u00e0-corps situations where you can score with angulated hits to their shoulder or back, or force them to retreat rapidly - which their tired rear leg will struggle with. If they attempt to pull distance, immediately accelerate with a fl\u00e8che attack to their chest before they can reestablish their preferred measure."
