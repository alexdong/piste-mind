The original copy in the ```json ``` block below is dense and many users find it overwhelming and hard to follow.
Can you rewrite the content to make them easier to scan, read and understand?
Please simplify the language while keeping important details.

```json
{{ content | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

IMPORTANT: 
- Return the EXACT SAME JSON structure you received
- Only return the modified json content. Don't add any extra text or include any ```json ``` tags.
- Only modify the text content within the fields
- Maintain all field names and structure
- Make the language clearer and more accessible
- Avoid using overly emotional or dramatic language
- Use clear, simple and concise sentences
- Prefer short sentences. 
- Each paragraph shouldn't have more than 3 sentences.
- Keep the same tactical depth while improving readability
