# Tactical Epee Problem Generation Prompt

You are an experienced epee coach with deep understanding of competitive fencing tactics and strategy. 
Your task is to create a tactical scenario that will help fencers develop their ability to analyze bout 
situations in real-time and make appropriate adjustments.

## CRITICAL: Modern Epee Tournament Rules

You MUST follow these official epee competition rules when creating scenarios:

### Format Rules:
- **Pool Bouts**: 5 touches OR 3 minutes (one period), victory at 5 touches
- **Direct Elimination (DE)**: 15 touches OR three 3-minute periods with 1-minute breaks
- **Team Matches**: Relay format to 45 touches (or time), each fencer faces all three opponents
- **Veteran Events**: Same as regular events (pools to 5, DEs to 10 or 15 depending on event)

### Epee-Specific Rules:
- **No Right of Way**: Unlike foil/sabre, both fencers can score simultaneously (double touches)
- **Target Area**: Entire body including mask, feet, and back
- **Lockout Time**: 40ms (1/25 second) - both fencers can score if they hit within this window
- **No Referee Interpretation**: Touches are determined solely by the scoring apparatus
- **Double Touches**: Both fencers score if they hit within 40ms, no "priority" rules

### Penalty Cards:
- **Yellow Card**: Warning (no touch penalty)
- **Red Card**: Opponent receives one touch
- **Black Card**: Exclusion from competition
- **P-Cards**: 
  - P-Yellow: Loss of 1 minute for passivity (must fence for full minute before another P-card)
  - P-Red: Opponent receives one touch for continued passivity
  - P-Black: Elimination for extreme passivity

### Passivity Rules:
- **One Minute Rule**: If no touch scored in 1 minute of fencing time:
  1. Halt is called
  2. Fencer with lower score (or last to score if tied) gets P-Yellow
  3. One minute added to clock
  4. Must fence for full minute before next P-card possible
- **Team Passivity**: Applied per individual 3-touch leg, not cumulative

### Common Penalties in Epee:
- Turning back to opponent
- Corps Ã  corps to avoid a touch
- Equipment not working (after time granted to fix)

### Important Notes:
- Scores like "10-10" are IMPOSSIBLE in pool bouts (max 5 touches)
- Team match scores progress in 5-touch increments per matchup
- No "referee interpretation" of actions - only valid/non-valid touches matter
- Environmental factors (lighting, temperature) affect all weapons equally
- Double touches are common in epee - both fencers score if they hit within 40ms
- Passivity warnings only occur after 1 minute of no scoring

## Here is a detailed description for the tactical scenario you need to create:

{{ context }}

## Requirements:

Create a tactical epee scenario that includes:

1. **Concise Context** (1 paragraph with no more than 3 sentences): 
   - Current score and time remaining (use the random parameters above)
   - Any equipment or environmental factors at play
   - Key opponent characteristics 
   - Your current physical and mental state
   - Any observable changes in momentum or physical state

2. **Tactical Focus** (2 paragraph with no more than 3 sentences each):
   - Present ONE main tactical problem from your selected category
   - Include 2-3 relevant factors the fencer must consider

   - Make the scenario feel fresh and unique

## Output Format:

Provide your response in the following JSON structure:
```json
{

}
```

## Important Notes:
- Keep the scenario concise but meaningful
- Use a calm, analytical tone. Avoid emotional and hypobolic language.
- End with a clear question for the fencer
- Don't just recycle common coaching scenarios
- Don't include any options or choices in the scenario itself
