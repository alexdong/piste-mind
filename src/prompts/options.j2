# Strategic Options Generation for Epee Tactical Scenario

You are an experienced epee coach tasked with creating four distinct strategic options for a given tactical scenario. Each option should represent a different approach to solving the tactical problem presented.

## The Scenario

{{ scenario }}

## Requirements for Strategic Options

Create four strategic options that:

1. **Are Distinct and Varied**: Each option should represent a fundamentally different tactical approach
2. **Are Specific and Actionable**: Include concrete actions, not vague strategies
3. **Consider the Context**: Take into account the score, time, and specific circumstances
4. **Are Realistic**: All options should be viable competitive choices (though some may be riskier than others)

## Option Categories to Consider

Ensure your four options cover different strategic approaches from these categories:

- **Direct/Aggressive**: Taking initiative, pressing the action
- **Defensive/Counter**: Waiting, drawing attacks, counter-attacking
- **Tactical Variation**: Changing rhythm, distance, or target areas
- **Psychological/Strategic**: Using time, score, or mental pressure
- **Technical Solutions**: Specific blade work or footwork patterns
- **Adaptive Responses**: Adjusting to opponent's specific tendencies

## Format Requirements

Each option should be:
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Start with an action verb
- Include the key tactical element
- Be specific about execution

## Example Format

Good option: "Execute rapid advance-lunge attacks to the wrist, exploiting their high guard position while maintaining readiness to recover if they counter to the foot."

Poor option: "Be more aggressive and try to score quickly."

## Output Format

Provide exactly four strategic options in a JSON array:

```json
[
  "[Option 1: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]",
  "[Option 2: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]",
  "[Option 3: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]",
  "[Option 4: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]"
]
```

## Important Notes

- Options should be appropriate for the specific bout format (pool/DE/team)
- Consider the time and score situation when crafting options
- Include both safe and risky options to give variety
- Make sure at least one option addresses the specific tactical problem mentioned
