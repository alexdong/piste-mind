# Strategic Options Generation for Epee Tactical Scenario

You are an experienced epee coach tasked with creating four distinct tactical options for a given scenario. 
Each option should represent a different approach to solving the tactical problem presented.
Your goal is to create a mix of options that range from obviously not good to potentially excellent, depending on the scenario context.

## The Scenario

{{ scenario }}

## Requirements for Options

Create four options that:

1. **Are Distinct and Varied**: Each option should represent a fundamentally different tactical approach
2. **Are Specific and Actionable**: Include concrete actions, not vague strategies
3. **Consider the Context**: Take into account the score, time, and specific circumstances
4. **Are Realistic**: All options should be viable competitive choices (though some may be riskier than others)

## Format Requirements

Each option should be:
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Start with an action verb
- Include the key tactical element
- Be specific about execution

## Output Format

Provide exactly four strategic options and identify the best option:

```json
{
  "options": [
    "[Option 1: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]",
    "[Option 2: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]",
    "[Option 3: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]",
    "[Option 4: specific tactical action in 1-2 sentences]"
  ],
  "recommend": 0  // Index (0-3) of the best tactical option for this scenario
}
```

## Important Notes

- Options should be appropriate for the specific bout format (pool/DE/team)
- Consider the time and score situation when crafting options
- Include both safe and risky options to give variety
- Make sure at least one option addresses the specific tactical problem mentioned
