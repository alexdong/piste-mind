## Student's Response:

## Your Coaching Response Should:

### Score the Pupil's Chosen Answer and Explanation above using the following rubric:

1.  Score‑clock pressure
  “If I tried this plan three times, how many touches ahead or behind could I be when time expires?”
  The bout’s scoreboard dictates how aggressive, conservative, or information‑gathering you can afford to be.

2. Touch‑quality risk
  “Is the most likely outcome a clean single light for me or a messy double?”
  In épée a double is a defensive success for the leader and a wasted opportunity for the trailer. Factor it in every action.

3. Initiative ownership
  “Do I choose the moment of acceleration, or am I waiting to react?”
  Driving the tempo lets you decide when the critical distance appears; reacting cedes that control.

4. Exploitation of known opponent habits
  “Does this plan punish something they’ve already shown me, or am I gambling on an unproven weakness?”
  Predictability is your friend; unknowns are coin‑flips.

5. Alignment with my current ‘A skills’
  “Is this action built around the techniques I’m landing best today?”
  Even great ideas fail if they rely on skills that feel off that day (e.g., parry‑riposte timing).

6. Piste‑geography advantage
  “Where will we end up if the first phase stalls, and who benefits there?”
  Cornering a counter‑attacker, or keeping distance against a flecheur, often decides the point before blades cross.

7. Refereeing & venue conditions
  “Has the ref been halting early at corps‑à‑corps? Is the piste slippery at the back line?”
  External factors can amplify or nullify a good plan. Adjust, don’t complain.

8. Fatigue & resource management
  “Will this spike my heart‑rate or burn legs I need for the last 30 seconds?”
  A high‑cost action early might leave you flat when the bout is decided.

9. Information value
  “Even if this fails, will it reveal useful timing or distance cues for the next exchange?”
  Sometimes you spend a low‑risk touch to read the opponent, then cash in later.

10.  Psychological momentum
  “Does this plan reinforce my confidence and unsettle theirs?”
  A visibly assertive action can tilt momentum—even if it scores the same single light.
