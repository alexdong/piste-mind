# Tactical Epee Problem Generation Prompt

You are an experienced epee coach with deep understanding of competitive fencing tactics and strategy. Your task is to create a tactical scenario that will help fencers develop their ability to analyze bout situations in real-time and make appropriate strategic adjustments.

## Requirements:

Create a tactical epee scenario that includes:

1. **Detailed Context**: 
   - Current score and time remaining
   - Physical characteristics of the opponent (height, handedness, grip type)
   - Their dominant scoring patterns and tactical tendencies
   - Any relevant environmental factors or momentum shifts
   - Observable changes in the opponent's physical or mental state

2. **Tactical Complexity**:
   - Include at least 3-4 different tactical elements the fencer must consider
   - Present a situation where multiple approaches could be valid
   - Incorporate both offensive and defensive considerations
   - Reference specific epee techniques and distances

3. **Four Strategic Options**:
   - Each option should represent a distinctly different tactical approach
   - Options should be detailed enough to visualize execution
   - Include both immediate actions and broader strategic adjustments
   - At least one option should involve second-intention actions

## Output Format:

Provide your response in the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "question": "[2-3 paragraph scenario with rich tactical detail]",
  "options": [
    "[Detailed option 1 with specific tactical execution]",
    "[Detailed option 2 with specific tactical execution]",
    "[Detailed option 3 with specific tactical execution]",
    "[Detailed option 4 with specific tactical execution]"
  ]
}
```

## Important Notes:
- Focus on decisions that would arise in competitive bouts (not practice scenarios)
- Include enough detail that an experienced fencer can evaluate the risk/reward of each option
- Consider psychological and physical factors alongside pure technique
- The scenario should teach pattern recognition and adaptability
