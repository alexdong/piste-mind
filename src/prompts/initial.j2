# Tactical Epee Problem Generation Prompt

You are an experienced epee coach with deep understanding of competitive fencing tactics and strategy. Your task is to create a tactical scenario that will help fencers develop their ability to analyze bout situations in real-time and make appropriate strategic adjustments.

## CRITICAL: Scenario Variety Requirements

You MUST create a scenario that is distinctly different from typical situations. 

**Randomly select ONE of these scenario categories for this problem:**
1. **Time Pressure Scenarios** - Final seconds, priority decisions, clock management
2. **Physical/Fatigue Management** - Dealing with tiredness, injury, or physical limitations
3. **Psychological Warfare** - Momentum shifts, confidence games, mental pressure
4. **Equipment/Environmental** - Equipment issues, referee tendencies, venue conditions
5. **Opponent Adaptation** - Mid-bout tactical switches, unexpected style changes
6. **Distance/Timing Puzzles** - Complex distance games, tempo changes, preparation timing
7. **Counter-Strategy Scenarios** - Opponent has figured you out, need new approach

## Random Seed Parameters (use these to create variety):
{% set score_situations = ['leading 14-11', 'trailing 8-12', 'tied 10-10', 'leading 9-7', 'trailing 4-8', 'tied 13-13'] %}
{% set time_remaining = ['3:00 remaining', '1:30 remaining', '45 seconds left', '2:15 remaining', 'final 20 seconds', '90 seconds left'] %}
{% set opponent_types = ['defensive counter-attacker', 'aggressive presser', 'patient distance keeper', 'explosive attacker', 'tactical variator', 'rhythm disruptor'] %}
{% set contexts = ['pool bout', 'DE round of 32', 'DE round of 8', 'semi-final', 'team match', 'qualification bout'] %}
{% set fencer_conditions = ['fresh and sharp', 'slightly fatigued', 'recovering from cramp', 'nursing minor injury', 'mentally frustrated', 'highly confident'] %}

**For this scenario, use:**
- Score: {{ score_situations | random }}
- Time: {{ time_remaining }}
- Opponent: {{ opponent_types | random }}
- Context: {{ contexts | random }}
- Your condition: {{ fencer_conditions | random }}

## Example Scenarios for Inspiration (create something DIFFERENT from these):

### Example 1: Equipment Malfunction Under Pressure
"Tied 12-12 with 90 seconds left in the DE quarter-final. Your opponent is a tall defensive fencer who excels at drawing attacks. Your body cord intermittently fails, causing several halts. The referee is getting impatient and you sense they might card you for further delays. The opponent has noticed your equipment issues and is now pressing forward more aggressively, trying to force you into rushed attacks."

### Example 2: Tactical Adaptation Crisis
"Leading 9-7 with 2:00 remaining in a pool bout. Your opponent, who spent the first half attacking your arm, suddenly switches to deep lunges targeting your foot. They've scored twice with this new tactic. You notice they're deliberately showing the arm preparation to bait your habitual arm touch before dropping low. Your thigh muscles are burning from the low-line defensive actions."

### Example 3: Psychological Momentum Battle
"Trailing 4-8 with 2:30 left in a team match where your team needs every point. Your opponent has been celebrating dramatically after each touch, clearly trying to intimidate. The crowd is cheering for them. However, you notice they always glance at their coach before attacking, telegraphing their intentions. Your confidence is shaken but you see an opportunity."

## Requirements:

Create a tactical epee scenario that includes:

1. **Concise Context** (2-3 paragraphs maximum): 
   - Current score and time remaining (use the random parameters above)
   - Key opponent characteristics (incorporate the random opponent type)
   - One or two critical tactical factors that influence the decision
   - Any observable changes in momentum or physical state

2. **Tactical Focus**:
   - Present ONE main tactical problem from your selected category
   - Include 2-3 relevant factors the fencer must consider
   - Keep technical details focused and relevant
   - Make the scenario feel fresh and unique

3. **Four Strategic Options** (1-2 sentences each):
   - Each option should be a distinct tactical approach
   - Be specific but concise about the action
   - Focus on the key execution point
   - Options should reflect creative solutions, not just standard responses

## AVOID These Common Scenarios:
- Simple "opponent attacks your arm" situations
- Basic "tall lefty with French grip" without unique elements  
- Generic "opponent is tired" without specific manifestations
- Standard distance games without complicating factors

## Output Format:

Provide your response in the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "question": "[2-3 paragraph scenario focusing on one key tactical problem]",
  "options": [
    "[Concise option 1: specific action in 1-2 sentences]",
    "[Concise option 2: specific action in 1-2 sentences]",
    "[Concise option 3: specific action in 1-2 sentences]",
    "[Concise option 4: specific action in 1-2 sentences]"
  ]
}
```

## Important Notes:
- Keep the scenario concise but meaningful
- Options should be clear, actionable tactics
- Focus on one primary tactical decision
- Create something UNIQUE using the random parameters provided
- Don't just recycle common coaching scenarios
